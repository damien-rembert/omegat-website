		Downloading the package

		Do you have a Java implementation compatible with Oracle's Java 8 JRE?

		Yes: download OmegaT_4.n.n_Windows_without_JRE.exe.

		No / I don't know: download OmegaT_4.n.n_Windows.exe.

		This package is bundled with Oracle's Java Runtime Environment. This JRE will not interfere with other Java
		implementations that may already be installed on your system.

		Installing OmegaT

		To install OmegaT, double-click on the program you have downloaded.

		At the beginning of the installation you can select the language to be used during the installation. In the
		following
		window you can indicate that the language selected is to be used in OmegaT. If you check the corresponding
		checkbox, the
		OmegaT.l4J.ini file is modified to use the language selected (see next section for details). Later, after you
		have
		accepted the license agreement, the setup program asks you whether you wish to create a folder in the Start
		menu, and
		whether you wish to create a shortcut on the desktop and in the quick launch bar - you can create these
		shortcuts later
		by dragging OmegaT.exe to the desktop or to the Start menu to link it from there. The last frame offers you to
		have a
		look at the readme and changes files for the version you have installed.
		Running OmegaT

		Once OmegaT is installed, you can click on OmegaT.jar to launch it directly or you can launch it directly from
		the
		command line.

		The simplest way to launch OmegaT, however, is to execute the OmegaT.exe program. The options for the program
		start-up
		in this case will be read from the OmegaT.l4J.ini file, which resides in the same folder as the exe file and
		which you
		can edit to reflect your setup. The following example for the INI file reserves 1 GB of memory, requests French
		as the
		user language and Canada as the country:

		# OmegaT.exe runtime configuration
		# To use a parameter, remove the '#' before the '-'
		# Memory
		-Xmx1024M
		# Language
		-Duser.language=FR
		# Country
		-Duser.country=CA

		Advice: if OmegaT works slowly in Remote Desktop sessions under Windows, you may use this option:

		-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=false

		Upgrading OmegaT

		This information applies only to the "Traditional" Windows versions of OmegaT. It does not apply to the Web
		Start
		versions, which are upgraded automatically, nor to cross-platform versions installed on Windows.

		If you already have a version of OmegaT installed on your PC and wish to upgrade to a more recent version, you
		have two
		options:

		Install over the existing installation. To do this, simply select the same installation folder as the existing
		installation when installing the new version. The "old" version of OmegaT will be overwritten, but any settings
		from it
		will be retained. This includes preferences set from within OmegaT, any changes you have made to your
		OmegaT.l4J.ini
		file, and also your launch script (.bat file), if you are using one.

		With this method, you may also download the "Windows without JRE" version, since the new installation will use
		your
		existing JRE.

		Install to a new folder. This will enable you to keep both versions side-by-side, which you may wish to do until
		you
		feel comfortable with the new version. This method will also use preferences and settings you have made from
		within
		OmegaT. In this case, however:

		If you have made changes to your OmegaT.l4J.ini file and/or are using a .bat file, you must copy these over.

		If your existing OmegaT installation is a "Windows with JRE" version, the new version must also be a "Windows
		with JRE"
		version.
